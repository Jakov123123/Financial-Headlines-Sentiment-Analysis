Experimenting with multiple different neural networks (Simple RNN, GRU, LSTM...) and database of a few thousands headlines I try to build a model which predicts which are positive, negative and neutral. There is a missing .txt document with GloVe Embeddings: it can be found here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. Original project can be found here: https://medium.com/@scheidlogan/financial-headline-sentiment-analysis-using-a-recurrent-neural-network-dabbfde08233
I have greatly expanded upon it by adding many different structures and implementing all kinds of different networks and ideas.
